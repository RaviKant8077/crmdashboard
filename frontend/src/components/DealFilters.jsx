The useTasks hook currently does not implement filtering, unlike useDeals which has filtering logic.

The Deals page and DealFilters component already have dropdown filters with sorting and filtering by customer.

The user wants to add filters to the deals page similar to the task page, but the task page currently does not have filters implemented.

So the user likely means to add filters to the deals page similar to what was created for the task page filters (maybe in a different branch or planned feature).

Given this, I should:
- Check if there is a TaskFilters component or similar that implements filters for tasks.
- If not, I can check the useTasks hook and the Tasks page to see if any filtering UI or logic exists.
- If no filters exist for tasks, then the user might want me to add filters to deals page similar to the filters that exist or are planned for tasks.
- Since the deals page already has filters, maybe the user wants to extend the filters on deals page to have more options or a more generic dropdown filter with value input and asc/desc order.

I will search for TaskFilters component or any filter components related to tasks.

If none found, I will check the useTasks hook for any filtering logic.

Then I will plan to extend the DealFilters component and useDeals hook to support more filter options with dropdown and value input, and asc/desc order.

I will also check the backend service for deals to see if it supports filtering and sorting by different fields.

I will search for "TaskFilters" component or "Filters" in the frontend components folder.
